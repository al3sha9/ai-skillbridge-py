## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis system that can classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. The model is trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset containing 50,000 reviews and achieves approximately 79% accuracy on the test set.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Comprehensive text cleaning including HTML tag removal, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical features for machine learning
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Binary classification for sentiment prediction
- **Performance Evaluation**: Detailed metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Interactive Prediction**: Function to predict sentiment of new text inputs

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset:
- **Size**: 50,000 movie reviews
- **Classes**: Positive (25,000) and Negative (25,000) reviews
- **Format**: CSV file with 'review' and 'sentiment' columns
- **Balance**: Perfectly balanced dataset

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sentiment-analysis-project
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required packages**:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk spacy matplotlib seaborn
```

4. **Download NLTK data**:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

5. **Download spaCy model**:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

2. **Execute cells sequentially** to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Preprocess the text data
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate performance
   - Make predictions on new text

### Using the Prediction Function

```python
# Example usage
review_1 = "This movie was absolutely fantastic! The acting was superb and the plot was gripping."
review_2 = "I was so bored throughout the entire film. It was a complete waste of time."

print(f"Review 1 Sentiment: {predict_sentiment(review_1)}")
print(f"Review 2 Sentiment: {predict_sentiment(review_2)}")
```
